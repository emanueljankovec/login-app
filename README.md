# login-app
To start application:
1. Navigate to backend folder via terminal and type "npm start"
2. Open new terminal and navigate to frontend folder and type "npm start"

The database is public so I hope it will not be a problem to connect to my data base.
Database url is in backend/.env file if there is need to change database url

I didn't use Typescript because I don't know well and I will need too much time to finish this project with Typescript, hope that's not a problem.
